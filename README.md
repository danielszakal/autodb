# autodb

NOT READY YET, please ignore

A very simple automated single table read-write Active Record Pattern implementation.

LIMITATIONS TO BE AWARE OF BEFORE YOU WOULD USE:

For now, supports only MySQL

For now, supports only databases with auto_increment positive integer primary keys

For now, we do not support editing of primary keys, but you should do that manually and carefully anyway
